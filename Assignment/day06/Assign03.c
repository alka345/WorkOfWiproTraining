/*
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position
where equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of   elements after it.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains integers denoting the elements
of the array.
Constraints
1<= n<=100
1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.

Output Format:
The output line contains integer denoting an equilibrium
index (if any) or -1 (if no equilibrium indexes exist).
TESTCASE 1:
Input:
7
[-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 1]
3
[-7, 0, 0, 0, -4, 4, 0]
